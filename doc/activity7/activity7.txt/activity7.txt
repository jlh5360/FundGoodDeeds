Activity 7

Question 1:

Component (interface): uniform interface with (open(), rename(), delete(), maybe size()).
- File

Composite (concrete class): manages children (add/remove/getChild) and implements the same File API by delegating to its children
- Folder

Leaf (concrete object): atomic with no children
- Text File
- Sound File

Explanation:
This structure reflects the Composite Design Pattern, where File is the common interface, and Folder and individual file types like Text File and Sound File are Composite and Leaf elements, respectively. It makes sense because Folder can contain other Files (both Folders and individual files), enabling a hierarchical tree structure where clients can treat all Files uniformly.


Question 2:

Component (interface):  defines the shared operations (draw, move, resize, bounds)
Drawable

Composite (concrete class): holds many Drawables and forwards operations to them 
Group

Leaf (concrete object): are indivisible shapes
Ellipse
Rectangle

Explanation:
The Drawable is the interface that defines drawing behavior, and both Group and shapes like Ellipse and Rectangle implement it. It makes sense because a Group can contain other Drawable objects, either groups or individual shapes, allowing uniform treatment of simple and complex graphics.



Question 3: RIT FMA Club

Component (interface)
Member

Composite (concrete class)
E-board
Portfolio Analysts

Leaf (concrete object)
Regular Member
President
Secretary
Treasurer
Elite Member
Cool Member
Club Advisor
Alumni 

The Member is the interface allowing uniform treatment of all club roles. E-board and Portfolio Analysts are Composites that group Members (like President, Secretary, Elite Member, etc.), whereas a regular member is just a simple instantiation of a member. A member is a generic interface that allows for further extensibility for concrete member objects, such as the Elite Member or Cool Member.They all share operations alongside their own respective operations for separation of concern.
